# **K Mean Clustering for k clusters**

![K Means Clustering](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94090874/214595050-88eec3b8-87ac-4aa7-b340-98220381360c.png)

*Demonstrates [K Means clustering](https://www.javatpoint.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-in-machine-learning) for k clusters in [Processing](www.processing.org)*

## How to run the file:
- After downloading both the files, compile and run them using [Processing](www.processing.org/download).
- Click the mouse to update the positions of the centroids.
- Press the DOWN Arrow Key to reset the clusters,
- Press the UP Arrow Kye to reset the positions of the centroids.

## Important Notice:
- The randomly generated data points in a cluster are generated approximated normally.
- All the datapoints are stored in the same "points" datastructure and the program does not differentiate the points in any way while iterating centroid positions.
- The initial position of the centroids is random and so is possible that the resultant centroid positions may not result in expected clusters.
